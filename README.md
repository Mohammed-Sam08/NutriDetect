# 🔍 NutriDetect – AI Powered Food Quality & Nutrition Detection System

NutriDetect is an AI + IoT based smart system **Hardware part is currently under development** to analyze:
- Fruit/Vegetable type  
- Freshness level  
- Organic vs Inorganic status  
- Nutrition insights  

The goal of this project is to use **hardware sensors and machine learning models**
to provide real-time food quality analysis for consumers and businesses.

> ⚠ Note: Hardware integration and real-time sensing phase is in progress.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)
- Image based food detection  
- Analysis by using Gas Sensor/Spectroscopy sensor   
- Ethylene gas freshness detection  
- ESP32 real-time data collection  
- Web dashboard for results  

## Tech Stack

### Hardware (Planned)
- ESP32  
- Spectroscopy Sensor/Gas Sensor  
- Ethylene Gas Sensor  
- OLED Display  

### Software (Developed)
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- OpenCV  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Flask / FastAPI  

## How It Will Work
1. User will place fruit/vegetable near sensors.  
2. Sensors will capture spectral & gas data.  
3. Data will be sent to ML model.  
4. Model will predict quality & nutrition.  
5. Results will be displayed on dashboard.  

## Use Cases
- Smart grocery stores  
- Farmer quality check  
- Food safety labs  
- Health & nutrition applications  

## Project Status
- Phase 1: System design & architecture ✅  
- Phase 2: Hardware integration ⏳ (ongoing)  
- Phase 3: ML model training ⏳ (planned)  
- Phase 4: Web & mobile dashboard ⏳ (planned)
